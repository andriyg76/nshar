# nshar.sh - Make self-extractable archives on Unix

**nshar** is a small shell script that generates a self-extractable
compressed tar archive from a file list. File archive can be launched as is. And also inserted as command into remote ssh terminal. This is pretty
similar to archives generated with WinZip Self-Extractor in the Windows world.

nshar assumes, that tar gzip and base64 is part of default unix installation.

The resultant archive is actually a compressed by gzip, bzip2 TAR archive, with a small shell script stub at the
beginning. 

Code is based on makeself [makeself.io](http://makeself.io) codebase.

## Usage

The syntax of nshar is the following:

```
nshar [args --] list of files or dirs
```

  * _args_ are optional options for nshar. The available ones are :

    * **`--version`** : Prints the version number on stdout, then exits immediately
    * **`--bzip2`** : Use bzip2 instead of gzip for better compression. The bzip2 command must be available in the command path. 
    * **`--xz`** : Use xz instead of gzip for better compression. The xz command must be available in the command path. 
    * **`--compress`** : Use the UNIX `compress` command to compress the data. This should be the default on all platforms that don't have gzip available.
    * **`--nocomp`** : Do not use any compression for the archive, which will then be an uncompressed TAR.
    * **`--complevel`** : Specify the compression level for gzip, bzip2, pbzip2, xz, lzo or lz4. (defaults to 9)
    * **`--uuencode`** : Encode the archive to ASCII in uuencode/decode format (default format is base64).
    * **`--compat`** : Encode archive in uuencode/decode, compress with compress. 
    * **`--follow`** : Follow the symbolic links inside of the archive directory, i.e. store the files that are being pointed to instead of the links themselves.
    * **`--nooverwrite`** : Do not extract the archive if the specified target directory already exists.


## Startup Script

The startup script is be a regular Shell script. 

Within the startup script, you can use the `$USER_PWD` variable to get the path of the folder from which the self-extracting script is executed. 

## License

Makeself itself is covered by the [GNU General Public License][8] (GPL) version 2 and above. Archives generated by Makeself don't have to be placed under this license (although I encourage it ;-)), since the archive itself is merely data for Makeself.
